# 🔧 Compilation Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### **CombinedMovieRepository.kt Structural Problems**

**Problem**: Missing closing braces and malformed try-catch blocks causing compilation errors:
- `Expecting ')'` on line 276
- `Unexpected tokens` syntax errors  
- `Missing '}'` errors
- `Type mismatch` errors in result handling

**Root Cause**: During the optimization refactoring, some method structures were broken, specifically in the `getAvailableMovies` method where:
1. Extra whitespace was left after the `try {` statement
2. The `coroutineScope` block wasn't properly closed before the catch block
3. The result return was outside the coroutineScope

**Fix Applied**:
```kotlin
// Before (Broken)
suspend fun getAvailableMovies(page: Int = 1): Result<List<CombinedMovie>> {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        try {
            
            coroutineScope {
                // ... code ...
                
            Result.success(combinedMovies)  // ❌ Outside coroutineScope
        } catch (e: Exception) {         // ❌ Missing closing brace
            Result.failure(e)
        }
    }
}

// After (Fixed) 
suspend fun getAvailableMovies(page: Int = 1): Result<List<CombinedMovie>> {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        try {
            coroutineScope {
                // ... code ...
                
                Result.success(combinedMovies)  // ✅ Inside coroutineScope
            }                                   // ✅ Proper closing brace
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Result.failure(e)
        }
    }
}
```

### **StreamingViewModel.kt Reference Errors**

**Problem**: "Unresolved reference" errors for repository methods
- `getMovieWithStreamDetails` not found
- `searchAvailableMovies` not found
- Type inference issues

**Root Cause**: The repository methods existed but had syntax errors preventing compilation, which made them unavailable to the ViewModel.

**Fix**: Fixing the repository structure automatically resolved these reference issues since the methods were already correctly defined.

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

### **1. Structural Integrity**
- ✅ Fixed missing closing braces in `getAvailableMovies`
- ✅ Properly structured try-catch-finally blocks
- ✅ Ensured all `coroutineScope` blocks are properly closed
- ✅ Maintained proper indentation and code flow

### **2. Method Signatures**
- ✅ All repository methods now compile correctly
- ✅ Return types properly handled with `Result<T>` 
- ✅ Async/suspend functions properly structured
- ✅ ViewModelScope integration maintained

### **3. Error Handling**
- ✅ Proper exception handling in all methods
- ✅ Null safety maintained with Elvis operators
- ✅ Response code checking using `response.code()` per project specs
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for API failures
