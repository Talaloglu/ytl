## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users of the Movie App expect a fully-featured cinematic experience with user account management, personalized watchlists, viewing history tracking, and comprehensive settings control. The application must provide seamless authentication, allow users to discover and watch movies with subtitle support, track their watch progress, manage their watchlist, and customize their viewing experience through preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits the app, **When** they want to access personalized features, **Then** they can create an account or sign in through an authentication modal
2. **Given** an authenticated user browses movies, **When** they find a movie they want to watch later, **Then** they can add it to their watchlist and see it persist across sessions
3. **Given** a user is watching a movie, **When** they pause and exit, **Then** their progress is automatically saved and they can resume from where they left off
4. **Given** a user views the home screen, **When** the app loads, **Then** they see a hero section with featured content, continue watching section with their in-progress movies, and multiple curated movie sections
5. **Given** a user wants to find specific content, **When** they use the search feature, **Then** they see suggestions, genre quick-filters, and trending searches to help them discover content
6. **Given** a user wants to customize their experience, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can control theme preferences, video quality, subtitle options, and accessibility features
7. **Given** a user is watching content, **When** they enable subtitles, **Then** they can select from available languages and customize subtitle appearance (size, color, position)
8. **Given** a user returns to the app, **When** they navigate to their profile, **Then** they can view their watch history, manage their avatar, and update their display name
9. **Given** a user filters movies by category, **When** they apply genre, year, or rating filters, **Then** the results update in real-time with optimized pagination
10. **Given** a user manages their content library, **When** they access their watchlist, **Then** they can filter, sort, and remove items with changes syncing to their cloud account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user loses internet connection while watching? Progress must be saved locally and synced when connectivity returns
- How does the system handle authentication token expiration? Users should be seamlessly re-authenticated or prompted to sign in again
- What happens when subtitle data is unavailable for selected language? System should show available alternatives and allow fallback options
- How does the app behave on memory-constrained devices? Memory management must prevent crashes and provide graceful degradation
- What happens when users have extensive watch history? Pagination and lazy loading must prevent performance degradation
- How does the system handle concurrent device usage? Watch progress and watchlist changes must sync correctly across multiple sessions
